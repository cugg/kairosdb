FAST (2 days) FIX FOR LAMPIRIS.
MADE KAIROS WORK WITH DST AND LEAP YEAR.
WORKING AND USED IN PRODUCTION

KairosDB is a fast distributed scalable time series database written primarily for Cassandra but works with HBase as well.

Because it is written on top of Cassandra (or HBase) it is very fast and scalable. With a single node we are able to capture 40,000 points of data per second.

Documentation is found [here](http://code.google.com/p/kairosdb/).
